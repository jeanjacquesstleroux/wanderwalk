    It stores the torus parameters R and r, the major and minor radius, 
    respectively. 
    
    The class also includes methods for parameterization 
    (converting between torus coordinates (u, v) and Cartesian coordinates 
    (x, y, z)), computing surface normals and tangent directions, projecting 
    points in R^3 onto the torus surface, and simulating Brownian motion 
    using the Euler-Maruyama method.
    
    The Torus class ensures that all simulated points are constrained to the 
    torus manifold for each step to an updated position on the torus. It also 
    enables simulations to store the trajectory a point takes after many time 
    steps.
