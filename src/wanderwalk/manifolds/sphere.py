    Since points on the manifold must be normalized, the magnitude 
    of a point x is equal to 1 (unit length). The tangent vector v 
    of a point x satisfies dot product of x and v is equal to 0. This 
    means they are orthogonal to each other and the tangent vector v 
    is on the tangent space of x.

    the next position which is also on the manifold.
